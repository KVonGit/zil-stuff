<!-- ************KOWW'S CHASM************ -->
[[Koww's Chasm]]:
You are in <font color=red>Koww's Chasm</font>.<br/>
There is nobody here.<br/>
There is a [sign] and the [chasm] here.<br/>
You can go [[east]](Zeke's Farm).<br/>
You are outside in a pasture of pure, pure green.  Green as far as the eye 
can see.  But you, Koww the Magician, are not satisfied.  The grass may be 
even greener on the other side of the <strong>chasm</strong>... you must 
know! Also in the area is a very undramatic <strong>sign</strong>.
{if gotflyscroll:

[Use fly scroll.](FLY)}

[sign]:
**\> examine sign**

It reads: "<em>Got milk?  Come to Farmer Zeke's mag-NIFicent silo!</em>"

[take sign]:
**\> take sign**

You yank the sign out of the ground and try to fit it in your Koww-pack. 
But it just doesn't fit.  Frustrated, you put it back.

[chasm]:
That's the chasm you simply MUST cross!  Surely the only way to cross it 
is to [FLY]!

[take chasm]:
Don't worry, the men in the white coats will soon be here to deal with you.

[FLY]:
    if (squiffy.get('gotflyscroll')){
      squiffy.story.passage('endproc');
    }
    else {
      squiffy.story.passage('noscroll');
    }

[noscroll]:
That's not a spell you know.  But perhaps if you could find a scroll -- 
like the ones owned by the Great Phoenix -- you could do so.


[endproc]:
@clear
You fly up and over the chasm!<br/>
Congratulations, you have found out that you were better off where you 
started anyway.  The grass here is brown and crackly.  Too bad!  And... OH 
NO!  Now you're trapped here, alone with the NecroYaks!  Stay tuned for 
"The Adventures of Koww the Magician II -- Escape from the NecroYaks!"

<!-- ***********ZEKE'S FARM********** -->
[[Zeke's Farm]]:
You are in <font color=red>Zeke's Farm</font>.<br/>
There is nobody here.<br/>
There is the [haystack] and the [pond] here.<br/>
You can go [[west]](Koww's Chasm), [[south]](Goblin Trail), 
[[east]](Phoenix Mountain Pass), or [[north]](Land of the NecroYaks).<br/>
You can go to [[Zeke's Farmhouse]], or [[Zeke's Silo]].<br/>
You stand outside of a small <strong>farmhouse</strong> with a 
<strong>silo</strong> beside it.  There are a <strong>haystack</strong> 
and a <strong>pond</strong> here.

[haystack]:
About what you'd expect from a haystack.  It's made of... HAY!  You 
[munch](take haystack) on it for a while.{if gotpitchfork:

[Use pitchfork on haystack.]}

[take haystack]:
You take a bite of the haystack.  Yummy... tastes just like chicken!

[Use pitchfork on haystack.]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('pitchfork');
    squiffy.koww.give('jade statuette');
<hr/>
You stab the pitchfork into the haystack.  Lo and behold, the haystack 
falls down into a hole in the ground!  Inside the hole is a jade statuette,
 which you take.

[pond]:
A nice, placid [pond](take pond) full of little tiny duckies.  Ooo, how 
cute!  If you were carnivorous, they'd make you hungry.{if gotsomething:

[Use something on the pond.]}

[Use something on the pond.]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('something');
    squiffy.koww.give('duck turd');
<hr/>
You throw the something into the lake.  The ducks swarm around it in 
curiosity.  You take the opportunity to grab a duck turd without being 
noticed!

[take pond]:
You sip the water from the pond.  Just what you need to wash down a bit of 
grazing.

<!-- ************ZEKE'S FARMHOUSE********** -->
[[Zeke's Farmhouse]]:
You are in <font color=red>Zeke's Farmhouse</font>.<br/>
This is nobody here.<br/>
{if not gotnothing:There is the [table] here.<br/>}
You can go [[out]](Zeke's Farm).<br/>
You're inside Farmer Zeke's rather cramped home.  No one's here at the 
moment. Perhaps you should go away.

[table]:
Hmmm, what's a table doing here?  Cool!  It has a 
<strong>[treasure chest]</strong> on it!

[take table]:
Farmer Zeke took the wise precaution of bolting his table to the floor.

[treasure chest]:
    squiffy.koww.give('nothing')
<hr/>
Ooooo!  There's nothing inside!  Told ya you should have gone away.

<!-- *************ZEKE'S SILO************** -->
[[Zeke's Silo]]:
You are in <font color=red>Zeke's Silo</font>.<br/>
You can see <strong>[Zeke]</strong> here.<br/>
You can go [[out]](Zeke's Farm) to Zeke's Farm.<br/>
Gee, this place smells just like rotting feed.  Standing in the silo, 
grinning like the idiot that he is, is Farmer <strong>Zeke</strong>.
{if gotpurplepaint:

[Use purple paint.](use purple paint)}

[Zeke]:
He's wearing a straw hat and at least one of his teeth is rotting away, 
but he seems pleased as punch that you've arrived.{if gotmilk:

"Hey there, good buddy!  Say, bein' a wizard an' all, couldja find it in 
yer heart to [gimme some magic milk](give milk to zeke)?  I'm all out!"}

[give milk to zeke]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('milk');
    squiffy.koww.give('pitchfork');
<hr/>"Well, thanks a lot, good buddy!  Well, tell ya what, why don't I 
give ya this here pitchfork ta comp'n'sate ya fer yer milk."

[use purple paint]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('purple paint');
    squiffy.ui.write(squiffy.koww.itemsList());
<hr/>
You spread the purple paint on yourself.  Suddenly Farmer Zeke bursts into 
song!

"<em>I never saw a purple cow, and I never hope to see one; but I can tell 
you anyhow, I'd rather see than be one!</em>"<br/>
Wonderful!  You have just activated the scenario's secret feature!  That's 
it.  Return to your home.  There's nothing more to do here.

[kill zeke]:
You may be an evil sorcerer, but at least you're an ETHICAL evil sorcerer. 
No killing allowed!  Especially not of idiots.  They don't know they're 
idiots.

[splash milk on zeke]:
@clear
"Well, gee," says Farmer Zeke, "I shore do like ya a lot, but I guess 
there's a limit!"<br/>
So saying, Zeke stabs you with his pitchfork.<br/>

Idiot.  You die.  HA HA HA HA HA!

<!-- *************GOBLIN TRAIL*************** -->
[[Goblin Trail]]:
You are in <font color=red>Goblin Trail</font>.<br/>
There is nobody here.<br/>
There is the [road] here.<br/>
You can go [[north]](Zeke's Farm) or [[south]](Goblin Lair).<br/>
The stench of goblins permeates this place.  Goblins are small, annoying 
creatures who like to fight anyone who looks weak.  Fortunately, you don't 
look weak.

[road]:
It's made of dirt.  Concrete hasn't been invented yet.

[take road]:
But you're already taking the road!  You're taking it either north or 
south! Har har har!  Hey, I saw a car transform the other day!  Yeah, it 
turned into a driveway!

<!-- *************GOBLIN LAIR**************** -->
[[Goblin Lair]]:
You are in <font color=red>Goblin Lair</font>.<br/>
You can see the [goblin guard] here.<br/>
There is the [cliff] here.<br/>
You can go [[north]](Goblin Trail).<br/>
You can go to [[Inside the Goblin Lair]].<br/>
About twenty goblins patrol the front of a massive cave complex.  They eye 
you for a moment, then decide not to attack.  You return the favor and 
don't kill them.

[cliff]:
It's a cliff; you could [climb] it, but it might be a difficult climb.

[take cliff]:
If you want to climb the cliff, say so!

[climb]:
After a difficult climb, you reach the top.  You're very pleased with 
yourself. Unfortunately, the ledge crumbles beneath you and you plummet 
back to the ground.

[goblin guard]:
It's very ugly, like most of its kind.  Don't get too close; you could 
faint from the smell.

"Yu wan go cave?  No try no funny bizniss -- I can tell."{if gotnothing:

[Give nothing to the goblin guard.]}

[Give nothing to the goblin guard.]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('nothing');
    squiffy.koww.give('something');
<hr/>
"Ooooo!  Nuthing!  Jus wut I all ways want'd!  Inn ex chaynge, I giv yu 
summ thing!"

<!-- **************INSIDE THE GOBLIN LAIR************* -->
[[Inside the Goblin Lair]]:
You are in <font color=red>Inside the Goblin Lair</font>.<br/>
You can see the [Goblin King] here.<br/>
There is the [statues] here.<br/>
You can go out to [[Goblin Lair]].<br/>
You are escorted to the Goblin King's throne room, a large chamber 
ornamented with statues of nude female goblins.  You try hard to avoid 
puking.

[statues]:
Apparently, the goblin idea of beauty is the same as the bovine idea of 
putridity.  You'd prefer not to look at these statues.

[take statues]:
That would be difficult, considering the statues are about seven feet 
tall, are made of stone, weigh about a ton, and are guarded by some 
mean-looking goblins.

[Goblin King]:
An officious-looking, double-chinned goblin monarch sits royally atop a 
throne of deer hide.

"Hoo hoo hoo!  Goblinz so grate, our spit is assid!  We spit on yu if yu 
make us angree!{if gotjadestatuette: If yu hav [tiny statyoo of jade], we 
giv yu 
nice thing!}"{if gotduckturd:

[Give duck turd to the Goblin King.](duck turd)}

[tiny statyoo of jade]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('jade statuette');
    squiffy.koww.give('jar of spit');
<hr/>
"Ooooo!  You find goblinn lost statyoo!  We giv yu wun jar of spit!"

[duck turd]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('duck turd');
    squiffy.koww.give('grappling hook');
<hr/>
"Ooooo!  GIMME GIMME GIMME!  Duck turd favorite goblin food!  We giv yu 
grapple hook!"

<!-- ***************LAND OF THE NECROYAKS************** -->
[[Land of the NecroYaks]]:
You are in <font color=red>Land of the NecroYaks</font>.<br/>
There is nobody here.<br/>
There is a [sign](look at sign) here.<br/>
You can go [[south]](Zeke's Farm) or [[north]](Deep in NecroYak Territory).

The greenness of the farmland dissolves into gray bleakness as you pass 
into the land of the NecroYaks.  Yaks are the sworn enemies of cows -- 
you'd better stay on your toes!

[look at sign]:
It reads: "<em>Unless you own a vial of acid that you can give to the 
NecroYaks for their sinister experiments, do not proceed on pain of 
Death!</em>"

[take sign]:
Oh, THAT'S original.

<!-- ***************AMBUSH POINT*************** -->
[[Deep in NecroYak Territory]]:
You are in <font color=red>Deep in NecroYak Territory</font>.<br/>
There is nobody here.<br/>
You can go [[south]](Land of the NecroYaks).<br/>
A cliff face blocks your way here.  It's steep -- you can't climb.  If you 
want to continue, you'll have to [search] the face.

[search]:
    if (squiffy.get('gotjarofspit')){
      squiffy.story.passage('yakslove');
    }
    else {
      squiffy.story.passage('yakskill');
    }

[yakslove]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('jar of spit');
    squiffy.koww.give('phoenix feather');
<hr/>
The NecroYaks jump out and search you for acid.  They find your goblin 
spit, take it, and run off.  But one of them drops a <strong>phoenix 
feather</strong>, and you scoop it up unnoticed.  By the way, there's no 
way to go farther  this  way unless you're a yak.

[yakskill]:
    squiffy.set('obittime', new Date().toLocaleString());
@clear
The NecroYaks recognize you as a cow, then jump out and kill you.

Idiot.  You die.  HA HA HA HA HA!

<!-- ***************PHOENIX MOUNTAIN PASS*************** -->
[[Phoenix Mountain Pass]]:
You are in <font color=red>Phoenix Mountain Pass</font>.<br/>
There is nobody here.<br/>
There is the [mountains] here.<br/>
You can go [[west]](Zeke's Farm) or [[east]](Phoenix Peak).<br/>
The towering mountains surround you on all sides but back to your west.  
Passage farther east is remotely possible, should you be brave or foolhardy 
enough to try it.

[mountains]:
They tower up almost as high as the Great Auk Mountains far, far to the 
north.{if gotgrapplinghook:

[Use the grappling hook on the mountains.](use grappling hook on mountains)
}

[take mountains]:
After several hours of effort, you manage to chip a piece off of the 
mountain you're standing on.  But you accidentally let go and it plummets 
into the valley below.

[use grappling hook on mountains]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('grappling hook');
    squiffy.koww.give('purple paint');
<hr/>
On top of the mountain, you find a bunch of purple paint, which you take.  
After descending again, you ditch your grappling hook.

<!-- ***************PHOENIX PEAK**************** -->
[[Phoenix Peak]]:
You are in <font color=red>Phoenix Peak</font>.<br/>
You can see the [Resplendent Magnificent Phoenix] here.<br/>
You can go [[west]](Phoenix Mountain Pass).<br/>
After hard hours of climbing, you finally reach the summit of Phoenix Peak.  
Here, in all its glory, sits the Resplendent Magnificent Phoenix.

[Resplendent Magnificent Phoenix]:
The Resplendent Magnificent Phoenix's visage is so brilliant that it hurts 
to look at it.

"The Resplendent Magnificent Phoenix demands to know <em>why</em> such a 
weakling as you has come here!{if not gotflyscroll:  If you do not have my 
wing feather with you, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave immediately!  
Now, do you have my wing feather or not -- <strong>[Yes]</strong> or 
<strong>[No]</strong>?}"

[Yes]:
    if (squiffy.get('gotphoenixfeather')){
      squiffy.story.passage('phoenixproc');
    }
    else {
      squiffy.story.passage('phoenixkill');
    }

[phoenixproc]:
    squiffy.koww.lose('phoenix feather');
    squiffy.koww.give('fly scroll');
"Thank you; you have found my wing feather.  In the wrong hands, that could 
have been very dangerous.  I will give you this "fly" scroll to compensate 
you for your hard work.  <strong>Use</strong> the scroll to fly, but it 
will only work once."

[phoenixkill]:
    squiffy.set('obittime', new Date().toLocaleString());
@clear
"Then give it to me quickly!  What..... You don't have my wing feather at 
all, do you?  You shammer.  I was going to dismiss you without hurting 
you, but I'm afraid now I'll have to kill you."<br/>
The Resplendent Magnificent Phoenix bats you with one claw.  You roll 
back down the mountainside, finally coming to a complete stop looking 
very much like a well-done steak.

Idiot.  You die.  HA HA HA HA HA!
<hr/>
