      <strong>1. Introduction</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>Welcome, intrepid adventurer, to <em>The Adventures of Koww the Magician</em>! This is a game of wit, exploration, and inevitable bovine peril. You play as Koww, a magician (and also a cow, but don’t let that limit your dreams). Your goal? To discover if the grass is, in fact, greener on the other side of the chasm. But beware! The world is filled with dangers, cheeky farmers, and creatures that do not appreciate your cow-like tendencies.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3 id="how-to-play">
      <strong>2. How to Play</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>This is a classic text adventure. Type commands to interact with the world. Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>go east</strong> – Move in that direction.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>examine sign</strong> – Inspect objects around you.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>give milk to zeke</strong> – Give items to characters.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>speak to goblin guard</strong> - Speak to characters.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>use SOMETHING on SOMETHING</strong> – Sometimes this actually works.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>fly</strong> – This is unlikely to help, but it’s worth a shot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Experiment and explore! There’s no wrong way to play (except all the ways you can die, but we’ll get to that later).</p>
